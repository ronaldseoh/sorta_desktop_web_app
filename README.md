# sorta_desktop_web_app

This repo contains some experimental ideas for making pseudo-desktop apps using mainly [`Flask`](http://http://flask.pocoo.org/) and [`CherryPy`](http://cherrypy.org/). 

I am aware of some commercial-grade(?) projects like [`Electron`](https://electronjs.org/) that allows creation of desktop apps using web technologies, but I'm not very familiar with web frontends and hence [`NodeJS`](https://nodejs.org). At the same time however, I was looking for ways to offload some of the burden running user interfaces to web browsers, and incorporate some cool JavaScript libraries into user interface easily whenever I want them.

I am also trying out packages like [`infi.systray`](https://github.com/Infinidat/infi.systray) (for Windows) and [`rumps`](https://github.com/jaredks/rumps) (for macOS) to put tray icon/menubar items providing shortcuts to quit the app and so on.
